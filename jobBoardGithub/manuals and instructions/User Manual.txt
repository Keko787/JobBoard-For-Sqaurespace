Reformating/integrating your webpage design and styles/Changing CSS and styling:
	In the CSS styling section, go to the sub-section of re-formating/integrating your sqaurespace style.
	From there you can delete all of the CSS style code to overwrite them with your own.
	If you wish to implement the styles from your sqaurespace design, disable the preview mode of the program or copy and cut the code temporarily.
	Then inspect element via right clicking on the desired text or content and selecting "inspect element" or "inpsect"
	Then on the bottom of the console, there would be a console window tab called "styles"
	From there, copy the CSS styles based on comments in the code section.

Inputing data into data file:
	you can add html elements like <strong> to make text bold and <ul> and <li> to makes lists, the only exception is <p> because it is the default in the modal window but it would still be recognized so no 	worries.
	It must stay in one line, but it there is no limit to how long the length of the line can be, so you can make the description as long as you want.
	It is recommended to use a notepad or text editor to create the description and paste it into the description value.
