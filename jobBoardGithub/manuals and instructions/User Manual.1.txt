Reformating/integrating your webpage design and styles/Changing CSS and styling:
	In the CSS styling section (line 113 - 218), go to the sub-section of re-formating/integrating your sqaurespace style (line 147-218).
	From there you can delete all of the CSS style code to overwrite them with your own.
	If you wish to implement the styles from your sqaurespace design, disable the preview mode of the program or copy and cut the code temporarily.
	Then inspect element via right clicking on the desired text or content and selecting "inspect element" or "inpsect"
	Then on the bottom of the console, there would be a console window tab called "styles"
	From there, copy the CSS styles based on comments in the code section
